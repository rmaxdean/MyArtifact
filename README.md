MyArtifact
==========
MyArtifact provides a semi-programmable interface to assist archaeologists in labwork related to recording information about cultural remains. The interface is built, and there is a form to help you structure data entry. Then you can enter data with the logic pre-defined. 

Install:
If you are not too familiar with MS Access, know that you just need the .accdb file.

Support:
Create an issue here in this repo.

This is tested on MS Access 2010; it will run on the full version. Next couple versions will ensure backwards compatability to Access 2007 (which it should run fine in, but I haven't tested it), and on the runtimes for both. MS Access users  for version 2003 and before, you are out of luck. If you are on Windows 8, yes this is forward-compatible. 

Development Trajectory:
I am continuing to develop this. Plan on seeing beneficial changes and a slow maturing of the app.
